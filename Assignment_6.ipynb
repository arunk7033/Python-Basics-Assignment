    "Escape characters are special characters that are used to represent certain non-printable or reserved characters within strings. They allow us to include characters in strings that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to include directly. Escape characters are typically preceded by a backslash (\\) to indicate that the following character should be treated specially.\n",
    "Here are some commonly used escape characters and their meanings:\n",
    "1.  \\n: Represents a newline character. It is used to create a new line in the string.\n",
    "    print(\"Hello,\\nWorld!\")\n",
    "    Output:\n",
    "    Hello,\n",
    "    World!\n",
    "2.  \\t: Represents a tab character. It adds horizontal indentation to the string.\n",
    "    print(\"Name:\\tJohn\")\n",
    "    Output:\n",
    "    Name:   John\n",
    "3.  \\\\: Represents a literal backslash character.\n",
    "    print(\"This is a backslash: \\\\\")\n",
    "    Output:\n",
    "    This is a backslash: \\\n",
    "4.  \\\" and \\': Represent double and single quotation marks within a string, respectively.\n",
    "    print(\"She said, \\\"Hello!\\\"\")\n",
    "    print('He\\'s coming.')\n",
    "    Output:\n",
    "    She said, \"Hello!\"\n",
    "    He's coming.\n",
    "5.  '\\b': Represents a backspace character, which moves the cursor one space backward.\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\\bWorld\")\n",
    "    Output:\n",
    "    HellWorld\n",
    "6.  '\\r': Represents a carriage return, which moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line.\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\\rWorld\")\n",
    "    Output:\n",
    "    World\n",
    "7.  '\\u' and '\\U': Used to represent Unicode characters using their hexadecimal code points.\n",
    "    print(\"\\u03A9\")  # Represents the Greek letter Omega (Î©)"
