    "    Functions offer several advantages that makes programs more organized, readable, maintainable, and efficient. Here are some key reasons why functions are advantageous in programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modularity and Reusability: Functions allow to break down a complex problem into smaller, manageable pieces of code. These smaller units of code can be reused across your program or in different programs altogether. This promotes modularity, which makes your codebase easier to maintain and update.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Readability: By using functions, we can give meaningful names to different parts of your code. This improves the overall readability of your program, making it easier for us  and other developers to understand the purpose and functionality of each part.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Abstraction: Functions abstract away the implementation details of a certain task. We can call a function to perform a specific task without needing to understand how the task is accomplished internally. This separation of concerns makes our codebase more organized and easier to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Code Organization: Functions provide a structured way to organize our code. Instead of having a single monolithic block of code, we can organize related tasks into separate functions. This makes it easier to locate and modify specific functionality as our program grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Testing and Debugging: Isolating different parts of our code in functions allows us to test and debug them independently. This helps in identifying and fixing issues more efficiently, as we can focus on a specific function's behavior without worrying about the rest of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Collaboration: When working in a team, functions help distribute the workload among team members. Different developers can work on different functions simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Efficiency: Functions can improve the efficiency of our program by reducing redundant code. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, we can write it once within a function and call that function whenever needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Parameterization: Functions can accept parameters, allowing us to create flexible and customizable behavior. By passing different values to function parameters, you can achieve different outcomes without duplicating code.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Encapsulation: Functions can encapsulate complex operations or algorithms, making the main program logic cleaner and more high-level. This encapsulation hides the complexity and provides a clean interface for the rest of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Library and Framework Usage: In Python, many libraries and frameworks are built around functions. By utilizing these pre-built functions, we can save time and effort, as well as leverage the expertise of the Python community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, functions enhance the structure, readability, and maintainability of your Python programs. They help us build organized, efficient, and modular codebases, which are essential for both small and large-scale software projects.\n"

    "The code within a Python function runs when the function is called, not when it is defined. When we define a function, we are essentially creating a reusable block of code with a specific name and a set of parameters (if any). This code doesn't execute immediately upon definition. Instead, it is only executed when we explicitly call the function using its name and provide any required arguments.\n",

    "    greet(\"Bob\")\n",
    "    # The code within the \"greet\" function is executed again, and it prints \"Hello, Bob!\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "As we can see, the code inside the greet function is only executed when the function is called (in this case, twice), not when the function is defined. This behavior allows us to control when and how many times a particular piece of code is executed by encapsulating it within a function and calling the function whenever needed."

    "2. Local Scopes: Local scopes are created within functions or code blocks.

    "Purpose of the try Clause:\n",
    "The try clause is used to enclose a block of code where we expect exceptions might occur. This block of code is monitored for exceptions. If an exception occurs within the try block, the normal flow of execution is interrupted, and the control is transferred to the corresponding except block (if present).\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of the except Clause:\n",
    "The except clause is used to specify how our program should handle a specific type of exception. It defines the actions to be taken if a particular exception occurs within the associated try block. Multiple except blocks can be used to handle different types of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic example to illustrate their purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Code that might cause an error\n",
    "        result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        # Code to handle the specific error\n",
    "        print(\"An error occurred: Division by zero\")"
