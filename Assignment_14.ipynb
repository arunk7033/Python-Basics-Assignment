    "RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. It is a color representation format often used in computer graphics and image processing. Each component represents a different aspect of the color:\n",
    "1. R: Red - This component specifies the amount of red color in the pixel. It can range from 0 (no red) to 255 (full red).\n",
    "2. G: Green - This component specifies the amount of green color in the pixel. Like the red component, it can also range from 0 (no green) to 255 (full green).\n",
    "3. B: Blue - This component specifies the amount of blue color in the pixel, with values ranging from 0 (no blue) to 255 (full blue).\n",
    "4. A: Alpha - The alpha component represents the pixel's transparency or opacity. It ranges from 0 (fully transparent) to 255 (fully opaque).\n",
    "RGBA is commonly used when working with images, as it allows us to control both the color and transparency of individual pixels or regions within an image. This format is often represented as a tuple or list of four integers, where each integer corresponds to one of the RGBA components. For example, (255, 0, 0, 128) represents a semi-transparent red color."
