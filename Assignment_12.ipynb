    "When working with the PdfFileReader() and PdfFileWriter() classes in Python's PyPDF2 library (or similar libraries for working with PDFs), we typically don't need to explicitly open the input PDF file in a specific mode. Instead, we provide the file name as an argument to the PdfFileReader() constructor, and the library handles the file opening and reading internally.\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader, PdfFileWriter\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open the input PDF file in read-binary mode\n",
    "    pdf_reader = PdfFileReader(open('input.pdf', 'rb'))\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a PdfFileWriter object for writing output\n",
    "    pdf_writer = PdfFileWriter()\n",
    "    \n",
    "In the example above, we use the open() function to open the input PDF file in read-binary mode ('rb'). However, this is done outside the PdfFileReader() constructor. The PdfFileReader() constructor takes the already opened file object as an argument.\n",
    "The same principle applies when using the PdfFileWriter() class. We don't need to open the output PDF file explicitly in a specific mode. Instead, we create a PdfFileWriter() object and use its methods to add content and pages to it. When we're ready to save the output PDF file, we can open it in write-binary mode ('wb') using the open() function and write the data from the PdfFileWriter() object into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from PyPDF2 import PdfFileWriter\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create a PdfFileWriter object for writing output\n",
    "    pdf_writer = PdfFileWriter()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Add pages or content to pdf_writer\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Open the output PDF file in write-binary mode and write data\n",
    "    with open('output.pdf', 'wb') as output_pdf:\n",
    "        pdf_writer.write(output_pdf)\n",
    "        \n",
    "So, to summarize, we typically open the input PDF file in read-binary mode outside the PdfFileReader() constructor, and we open the output PDF file in write-binary mode using the open() function when we're ready to save the modified PDF created with PdfFileWriter().\n"
