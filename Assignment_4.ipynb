    "Tuples and lists are both data structures in programming used to store collections of items, but they have some key differences in terms of their properties and usage. Here's a breakdown of the main differences between tuples and lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mutability:\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. Once a tuple is created, you cannot add, remove, or modify elements in it.\n",
    "Lists: Lists are mutable, allowing us to add, remove, and modify elements after creation. We can change individual elements, append new elements, or remove existing elements from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Syntax:\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are typically defined using parentheses () and comma , to separate elements, like (1, 2, 3).\n",
    "Lists: Lists are usually defined using square brackets [] and commas , to separate elements, like [1, 2, 3].\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Performance:\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are generally slightly more memory-efficient and faster to create compared to lists because of their immutability.\n",
    "Lists: Lists may have slightly higher memory overhead and creation time due to their mutable nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use Cases:\n",
    "Tuples: Tuples are often used when we have a fixed collection of items that won't change throughout the program's execution. They are suitable for representing things like coordinates (x, y), dates (year, month, day), and other structured data.\n",
    "Lists: Lists are used when we need a collection of items that may change, grow, or shrink during the program's execution. They are useful for tasks like maintaining dynamic lists of data, such as user inputs, database records, or processing sequences of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Methods and Operations:\n",
    "Both tuples and lists have some common methods, like len() to get the number of elements, indexing to access elements, and slicing to extract subsets of elements.\n",
    "Lists have more built-in methods for modification, like append(), insert(), remove(), and pop(), which are not available for tuples due to their immutability."

    "In Python, variables that \"contain\" list values (or other collections) do not actually contain the values themselves directly. Instead, they contain references or pointers to the memory locations where the actual values are stored. This is a fundamental concept in Python and is related to how memory management and object references work in the language.\n",

    "#Solution:\n",
    "In Python's copy module, both copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy() are used to create copies of objects, but they differ in terms of how they handle object references and nested objects.\n",
    "1. copy.copy():\n",
    "copy.copy() creates a shallow copy of an object. A shallow copy creates a new object, but if the object contains references to other objects (such as lists or other nested structures), the new copy will still refer to the same nested objects as the original.\n",
    "Shallow copying is useful when we want a new object that is a copy of the original, but we don't need the content of nested objects to be copied as well.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    import copy\n",
    "    original_list = [1, [2, 3]]\n",
    "    shallow_copy = copy.copy(original_list)\n",
    "    shallow_copy[1].append(4)\n",
    "    print(original_list)  # Output: [1, [2, 3, 4]]\n",
    "    print(shallow_copy)   # Output: [1, [2, 3, 4]]\n",
    "2. copy.deepcopy():\n",
    "copy.deepcopy() creates a deep copy of an object. A deep copy not only creates a new object but also recursively creates new copies of all the objects referenced by the original object, including nested objects.\n",
    "Deep copying is useful when we want a completely independent copy of the original object, including all its nested objects.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    import copy\n",
    "    original_list = [1, [2, 3]]\n",
    "    deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(original_list)\n",
    "    deep_copy[1].append(4)\n",
    "    print(original_list)  # Output: [1, [2, 3]]\n",
    "    print(deep_copy)      # Output: [1, [2, 3, 4]]\n",
    "In summary, we use copy.copy() when we want a new object that is a shallow copy of the original, and use copy.deepcopy() when we want a new object that is a deep, independent copy of the original, including all nested objects. The deep copying can be slower and more memory-intensive, especially for complex structures."
